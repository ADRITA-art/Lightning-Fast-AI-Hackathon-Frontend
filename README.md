## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### 🌐 **Frontend Integration**
The frontend of this project is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, adding type safety to the application.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.


### 📜 **Backend Technologies for the project:**

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
- **Flasgger (Swagger UI)**: API documentation tool to generate interactive API docs for the Flask app.
- **Flask-CORS**: A Flask extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the frontend to interact with the backend.
- **Python-dotenv**: A Python library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Python's logging module**: Built-in module for logging events and errors within the application.
- **SambaNova AI Models**: AI models integrated to leverage advanced processing and predictions.
- **Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct**: OCR model for image-to-text extraction and vision-related tasks.
- **Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**: Text processing and evaluation using a language model for advanced textual understanding.
- **Render**: Deployment platform for hosting the backend application.

### 📜 **Backend: API Integration for Prepia**
- **Framework:** Next.js (API Route)
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Primary API Used:** Sambanova API
- **HTTP Library:** Axios
- **Flow:**
  1. The user submits a question as a query parameter.
  2. The backend calls the Sambanova API to fetch an article.
  3. The response is processed and returned to the frontend.




### 🎙️ **Text-to-Speech Workflow**
- Articles generated by Sambanova API are fed into the **text-to-speech system using Azure**.
- **Goal:** Deliver dynamic audio responses to technical queries.
